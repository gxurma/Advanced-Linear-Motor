# Advanced-Linear-Motor
An advanced design for linear motors.  Uses also some advanced algorithms and python scripts to optimize the copper usage, resistance and heat dissipation

# Design goals
- 6 layer PCBs:
- 70µm or 105µm thick copper
- as packed with copper as possible
- 3 phases
- 1 phase 2 layers
- as few vias as possible
